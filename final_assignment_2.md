# Final Assignment 2

You will expand on weekly assignments 5, 6, and 10 to capture, clean, and store all data for "Process Blog"--a source of semi-structured, qualitative data. The data should be stored in Amazon DynamoDB and queried using the `aws-sdk` module in Node. You will design and create an interface to display relevant diary entries. 

### Some questions that may arise as you bind the data to the end-user interface:

1. What information does the end user need? How? Why?  
2. Which data is relevant for display in this project? How should it be displayed?  
3. What is the default view? Why?  
4. What is the minimum amount of data that can be queried to provide the necessary data for the visual representation?  

### Your work will be assessed on:

1. The integrity of the data  
2. The integrity of the database  
3. The efficiency of the queries and page load  
4. The choices of data structures  
5. The inclusion of relevant data  
6. The coherence and organization of your code and repository  
7. The method for binding the data to the visual representation
