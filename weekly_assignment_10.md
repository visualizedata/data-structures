# Weekly Assignment 10

## Assignment 

You will design three interfaces for visualizations for your three data sources (AA, process blog, and sensors).  **NOTE: there is no coding in this assignment. This is strictly a design exercise; the coding will be done for your final assignment submissions.**

You will submit sketches, materials, and documentation for your designs, which should include (at a minimum) the following information for each of the three designs for final assignments [1](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/final_assignment_1.md), [2](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/final_assignment_2.md), and [3](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/final_assignment_3.md):  

* What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?   
* How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?  
* For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?  
* What is the default view (if any)?  
* What assumptions are you making about the user?  

## Submission requirements

Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s). Use [GitHub markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to document your sketches and other materials. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository.
