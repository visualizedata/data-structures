# Final Assignment 3

## Due Sunday 12/16 at 10:00pm

Finalize an interface design for a web-based, interactive visual representation for the data generated by the two sensors you were assigned. The code and documentation should be specific, clear, and fully realized based on your design in Weekly Assignment 11. 

Submit a URL for your visual representation that returns a visualization that is constructed on real-time JSON from a query to your Postgres database. The returned data should be appropriate for the time of the query and map directly to the elements of the interface design you specified in Weekly Assignment 11. 

Your submission should consist of:  
1. the URL where the visualization is running  
2. the URL of your (well-documented!) GitHub repository for this project, which should include:    
3. detailed written and visual documentation to provide context for your work, including specifics on how your endpoint data connects to each of the elements of your final interface design 

### Your work will be assessed on:

1. The integrity of the data (and successful gathering of at least four weeks of good data)  
2. The integrity of the database  
3. The efficiency of the queries and page load  
4. The choices of data structures  
5. The inclusion of relevant data  
6. The coherence and organization of your code and repository  
7. The strategy for binding the data to the visual representation  
8. Reliability, scalability, maintainability, and sustainability
